Neural ammo:
- Differentiate between army/civillian?
- Fix rarity somehow
- Maybe rework some neural net aspects, rethink what goes first, etc..
- Add more irl pen statistics? Rework them to include army/civillian?
- Finish up adding all ammo

Armour plates:
- Add other plates
- Add a slot in armour to accomodate the plates
- Maybe add armour slots for baseball caps, lol?
- Rebalance stuff, make normal armour at least lvl 2, depending on normal lvl. Maybe restrict some armours to their specific plates?

Ports:
- based multi-mount (almost finished)

Modloader (priority from high to low):
- Figure out presets
- Trader support
- Use .filter() for finding something, instead of for-if.
- Rework some things? Make functions?
- copyMods or deleteMods function
- Expand on addMods to allow adding a mod slot

Ragfair:
- Increase spawn amount for some things? No seriously 0-3 bolts on ragfair is dumb, 5-10 would be better
- Optimise the ragfair file itself? "if-else" to "switch"

Balancing/Raids/Hideout:
- Dynamic raid timers
- Maps locked behind requirements (either dymamic weather or smth)

Translation:
- French and German are added like Mao does it. They don't work tho. Maybe rollback to v15?

Assembly:
- Look into making a new slot for our belt rigs
