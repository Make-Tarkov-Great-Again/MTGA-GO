added the 2 scripts to make punisher a boss,  to the bottom of cachemodload script,   and to the top of tampermodload script...    
the reason its at the top of tamperloadmod, is i edit the gameplay.json to remove bosstest from bots that pmc's can spawn from, as that is punishers bot.  
 
 added a few files/directories for the scripts to read from,  to the flea lock folder and database folder.    

 bosstest directory was added to database folder, since thats where most data is stored currently. 
 the bosswave.js and controller.js files were added to flea lock folder. 
 the bosswave.js is where you can change options for the bosschance and followers per map.  
 the controller.js sets punisher base bot to pmcbot,  actually not even sure this file is needed still... 

 feel free to edit or move stuff around as you see fit, if you move it be aware you'll need to edit the scripts to the right paths.
